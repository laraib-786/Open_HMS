    4. Install the Requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt.
    5. Navigate to the folder where the application was opened and traverse deeper through the directory until you are in the same directory that contains the file called manage.py.
    6. Then,make database migrations: “python manage.py makemigrations” followed by “python manage.py migrate”
    7. Type in the command "python manage.py runserver" on your command prompt or Terminal window and run it.

**STEPS FOR DEPLOYMENT:**

 This workflow will build and push a new container image to Amazon ECR, and then will deploy a new task definition to Amazon ECS, when there is a push to the main branch.
 
    1. A dockerfile is created containing the commands to setup and deploy the instances.
    2. An AWS ECR is cretaed, which is a container image repository used to store the docker images that are created for every deployment.
    3. AWS ECS is a cluster service that is used to deploy the docker image from ECR to a fargate server. The server task defination is available in deploy.json.
    4. A github action file is created to integrate and deploy for every push to the github repository which perform the following task to implement CI/CD
    
    Features:-
